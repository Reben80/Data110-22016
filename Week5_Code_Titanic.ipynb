This reduction in bins leads to a more generalized view of the data, merging individual age groups into broader categories. Here's what happens as a result:\n",

        "3. **Enhanced Clarity for General Trends:** The broader bins can help in highlighting the overall shape of the age distribution more clearly.

Conversely, for a high-level overview of passenger demographics, fewer, broader bins could be exactly what's needed.\n",

Conversely, if perceived as purely overlapping without recognizing the distinct distributions, it might obscure the comparative analysis between genders, especially in age ranges where one gender significantly outnumbers the other.\n",

        "- **Consider Alternative Visualizations:** For some audiences or purposes, separate histograms or density plots might convey the distributions more clearly without risking the overlapping/stacked confusion. Alternatively, adjusting the transparency (alpha value) or employing distinct color schemes can help differentiate the distributions more effectively.\n",
